Hi! I’m Lorenz Angelo Barrera. I’m passionate about designing easy-to-use and beautiful websites and apps. I enjoy solving problems through design and making sure people have a great experience when they use my work. I’m always excited to learn new things and improve my skills.

What UI/UX principles did you use and why?
I made the design simple and clear so people can find what they want quickly. I used the same fonts and colors all over to keep it looking neat and professional. I also made sure it works well on phones and computers. Plus, I thought about making it easy for everyone to use
What problems did you have and how did you fix them?
At first, I had trouble making the portfolio look creative but not too busy. I tried different designs and asked friends what they thought until it looked good. I also had a lot of projects to show, and it felt crowded, so I put them into groups and added filters to make it easier to find things. The site was slow because of big pictures, so I made the pictures smaller and only loaded them when needed.
How would you make the portfolio better next?
Next, I want to add stories about how I made each project, not just pictures. I’d like to see how people use the site so I can improve it. It would be cool to add a blog to share my thoughts about design. I also want to add a personal logo or some small animations to make it more unique. Finally, I’d like to show different things to different visitors, like recruiters or clients, so it fits what they’re looking for.
